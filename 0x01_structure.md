# 0x01 Course Planning

## Projects

- Digit Recognizer
- Dogs vs. Cats Classification
- NLP Projects (Twitter) - Geolocation of each tweet

Based on the projects: Digit Recognizer and Dogs vs. Cats Classification, we will learning the following things:

1. Learn more about the `Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)`
2. Learn more about the architecture of `VGG`
3. Learn how to implement networks in `Keras`
4. Data preprocessing techniques

    - File system
    - Image processing
    - Data cleaning
    - Data augmentation
    - Data feed

5. Based on the scientific paper, and implementing it by ourselves.

## Why we choose VGG

There are a lot of network structure we can choose. However the following reasons support my idea

- It is easy and straightforward
- The length of paper is not very huge
- The overall results for VGG is quite good

## CNN Projects Procedure

Stage 1:

- Learn more about Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition
- Read the abstract and conclusion of `VGG` paper
- Study the VGG network architecture through the paper
- Read the `Keras` documentation, and get started with example
- Based on the paper, use `Keras` to implement the `VGG16` or `VGG19`
- Compare our code with the official version, check the `summary`

Stage 2:

- Learn the overall knowledge in Image processing
- Get familiar with training data, analyze it
- Preprocessing the image data
- Generate the `training set`
- Based on the `VGG16` create our own network, which suits our need
- Train the model, and observe the performance, determine when should we stop it
- Evaluation (Very important)

It is very important to note that the training data of `Cats vs. Dogs` and `Digit Recognizer` has huge differences, hence we will learn a lot.

Stage 3:

- Learn the basic of `Regular Expression`
- Learn the basic of `Nature Language Processing`
- Get familiar with training data, analyze it
- Text mining and feature engineering
- Design multiple classification machine learning approaches by our own or based on existed paper
- Train the model, and observe the performance.

In the meanwhile, I think I will also show you the following things:

- GitHub
- Object-oriented Programming
- Cloud Computing
- Usage of Ubuntu
- Web-app application
